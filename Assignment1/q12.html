    <h3>Long Quote</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes we make the process more complicated than we need to. We will
      never make a journey of a thousand miles by fretting about how long it
      will take or how hard it will be. We make the journey by taking each day
      step by step and then repeating it again and again until we reach our
      destination.
