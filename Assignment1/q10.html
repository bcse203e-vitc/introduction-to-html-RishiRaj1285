    <hr />
    <p>
      Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other
      organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll.
      It is a crucial process for life on Earth, as it provides the oxygen we
      breathe and is the foundation of the food chain. During photosynthesis,
      plants convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, using
      sunlight as the energy source. Overall, photosynthesis is essential for
      maintaining the balance of ecosystems and supporting life on our planet.
